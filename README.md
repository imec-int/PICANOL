# PICANOL
##Unity project

###Issues
1. Camera copy ==> make sure that if a screenshot is being taken, we also capture the camera position at that time to find the correct depth points
2. removal of marker dots ==> only last is being removed
3. Screenshot copy should show markers on top
4. When clearing screen extra marker is dull (when pushing Clear button)

###To Do
'Multiplayer' setup: Helpuser shares a 'game' with assistant

circle instead of square dots?

Assistant creates screenshot and copy of camera to be able to point at an easy pace the workspot to be taken into account. Helper sees markernotations
