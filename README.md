# PICANOL
##Unity project

###Issues
1. Camera copy ==> make sure that if a screenshot is being taken, we also capture the camera position at that time to find the correct depth points
2. Screenshot copy should show markers on top ==> Show2DDots
3. screenshot should open automatically
4. no first marker when pushing the GUI button to record screenshot! ==> 

###To Do
'Multiplayer' setup: Helpuser shares a 'game' with assistant

draw circle instead of square dots?

Assistant creates screenshot and copy of camera to be able to point at an easy pace the workspot to be taken into account. Helper sees markernotations

###Solved issues
1. removal of marker dots ==> only last is being removed
2. When clearing screen extra marker is dull (when pushing Clear button)
