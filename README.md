##Unity project

###Issues
1. Camera copy ==> make sure that if a screenshot is being taken, we also capture the camera position at that time to find the correct depth points
2. removal of marker dots ==> only last is being removed
3. Screenshot copy should show markers on top

###To Do
'Multiplayer' setup: Helpuser shares a 'game' with assistant


Assistant creates screenshot and copy of camera to be able to point at an easy pace the workspot to be taken into account. Helper sees markernotations
